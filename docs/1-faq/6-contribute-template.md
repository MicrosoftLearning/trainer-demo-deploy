title: How do I contribute templates?
---

:::info DIFFERENT WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE

You can contribute to Trainer-Demo-Deploy in several ways:

 * **For an existing Portal site issue** - Check the **[list of open issues](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/trainer-demo-deploy/issues)**

 * **Provide your own demo scenario - end-to-end** - create your Github Repo artifacts following the guidelines in **[Create Template FAQ](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/trainer-demo-deploy/docs/faq/create-template)**.

 * **Contribute to an existing demo scenario** - a full demo scenario is comprised of Bicep template(s), Demoguide, (optional) Sample application. Some templates we have might have on Bicep template, but could use a sample app, or could use a more detailed demoguide, etc. If you think of contributing to an existing scenario, you can open a GitHub Issue in our Trainer-Demo-Deploy, or directly open a GitHub issue in the scenario-specific repo in GitHub (The link is available from the scenario card - details blade)
