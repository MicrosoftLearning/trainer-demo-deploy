title: How are templates rated?
---

This catalog contains both Microsoft Technical Trainer (MTT)-authored azd-templates, and Community Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT)-contributed versions. Creating **and maintaining** templates is not a simple exercise. 

For now, we assume that your contributions reflect the need for such a demo scenario as part of your training deliveries. We don't specifically rate templates, apart from tags **new** and **hot**, which gets updated monthly. 

In the long term, we may add other tag options to help rate templates on other criteria (e.g., recently updated, most stars, most forks etc.)
